The book

I have had the idea of writing a book about physics and its conceptual simplicity for quite a while. However, who buys and reads real book these days? Downloading a book as an electronic version and reading it on a phone or tablet is much more convenient. But then why not writing it in html directly? This variant allows the insertion of links or even simulations directly into the text. This is what I have done. I hope you will enjoy it. Unlike real books or electronic versions like the ones offered in the kindle store, my book is free. However, if you have enjoyed the read and think you would have spent 10 dollars for it in the kindle store, I have added a donation button so you can do that here too. 

Simplicity

As I say on my home page, I love simplicity. There is this famous quote from Einstein 

"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler". 


During my reasearch in physically based simulation over the last 20 years I always hat that quote in the back of my head. What is important to note here is that *making something simple is not a simple task*.

“Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”
