I have had the idea of writing a book about physics and its conceptual simplicity for quite a while. However, who buys and reads real book these days? Downloading a book as pdf and reading it on a phone or tablet is much more convenient. But then why not writing it as a series of html documents? The nice this is that this way one can insert links or even simulations directly into the text!
