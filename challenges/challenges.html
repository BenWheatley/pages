<span class = "emphasize">Position Based Dynamics</span> is a simple simulation method that has been extensively used in games and the movie industry. It has also the reputation of being non-physical and too simplistic. Not many people realize that two small changes have turned the toy into a <span class = "emphasize">serious competitor</span> of state of the art simulation methods in the four categories
<ul>
<li><span class = "emphasize">accuracy</span>
<li><span class = "emphasize">stability</span>
<li><span class = "emphasize">speed</span>
<li><span class = "emphasize">simplicity</span>
</ul>
as we describe <a href = "https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/smallsteps.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>. To show this, we have created simulations that are written in Javascript, fully contained in the html pages and visible on github.
The challenge is to <span class = "emphasize">replace the simulation part of the code with your own to beat PBD </span>in any of the above categories. So far we have two scenes, more will follow...
