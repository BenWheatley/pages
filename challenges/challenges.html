Reviewers often require a comparison of the proposed method with previous approaches. However, comparisons in paper are difficult in a series of ways:

<ul>
<li>The authors pick the competitor. Is that the state of the art method?</li>
<li>The authors pick the scene. Is it representative? Would the competitor beat the proposed method in other scenes?</li>
<li>The competitors do not have the chance to optimize their method for the given experiment.</li>
</ul> 

Here I start a new experiment. There are a series of challenges. Everybody is welcome to challenge our results. There is no deadline. Everybody can take as much time as they need to optimize and tune their methods. So far we have one challenge but more will follow:
